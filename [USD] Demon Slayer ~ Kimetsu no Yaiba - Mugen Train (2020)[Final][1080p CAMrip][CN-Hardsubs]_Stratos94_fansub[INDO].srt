1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,203
Yaichi.

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:04,205
Toyoyaki.

3
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:06,240
Issao.

4
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:08,109
Ryosuke.

5
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:10,111
Yukio.

6
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:12,079
Kaikaido.

7
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:26,727
Tuan Ubuyashiki, saatnya untuk kembali.

8
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,697
Tubuh Anda akan kewalahan.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,137
Saya tidak tahu berapa 
kali saya bisa kembali ke pemakaman ini.

10
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:46,380
Semua penyesalan anak muda ini

11
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:50,251
Saya berharap ini berakhir sebelum saya pergi.

12
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:53,687
Baru bulan ini

13
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,591
laporan korban yang disebabkan oleh setan

14
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,994
telah meningkat tujuh kali lipat.

15
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,433
Anak-anak saya dari Demon Slayer Corp.

16
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:09,169
Sekarang, kali ini

17
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:12,606
memimpin serangan melawan iblis.

18
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:19,246
Tidak peduli berapa banyak nyawa berharga yang diambil iblis.

19
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:22,950
Keinginan yang kuat

20
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:26,620
tidak pernah bisa diambil.

21
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,690
Tidak peduli seberapa besar hitnya

22
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:34,929
mereka akan tetap berdiri dan bertarung lagi.

23
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:26,080
Baiklah, ayo sembunyikan pedang kita dan naik kereta.

24
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,482
Oh tidak! 
Kereta akan berangkat!

25
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,219
Apa polisi sudah pergi?

26
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,088
Meski mereka masih di sini, 
kita masih harus naik kereta.

27
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,460
Ha ha! Pertarungan! Pemilik tanah!

28
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:40,694
Bodoh itu!

29
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,129
Ayo pergi!

30
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:45,199
Jangan tinggalkan aku!

31
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:49,870
Tunggu! Tunggu aku!

32
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:53,774
Piring! Inosuke!

33
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:55,075
Zenitsu!

34
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,793
Sangat cepat!

35
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,428
Maaf maaf.

36
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:16,830
Berhenti main-main! 
Kemari, idiot!

37
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,565
Hei!

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,241
Nenek, apakah ini tidak apa-apa?

39
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:29,009
Terima kasih untuk bantuannya.

40
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,477
Aku sangat menyesal...

41
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,245
Apa?

42
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,447
Jangan khawatir tentang itu!

43
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:47,227
Di mana pria yang seharusnya bertemu dengan kita, 
Hashira, kan?

44
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:49,530
Apa kamu tahu seperti apa dia?

45
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,334
Dia seharusnya sangat kurang ajar.

46
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:55,269
Saya juga ingat bau ashe.

47
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:59,039
Saya pikir saya melihatnya sebelumnya.

48
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:32,840
Film Pembunuh Setan: Kereta Tak Terbatas

49
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,309
Lezat!

50
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:37,244
Lezat!

51
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:39,113
Lezat!

52
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,750
Lezat!

53
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,486
Lezat!

54
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,356
Lezat!

55
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:52,025
Lezat!

56
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,194
Lezat!

57
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:56,730
Lezat!

58
00:04:58,867 --> 00:04:59,700
Lezat!

59
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,203
Lezat!

60
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:05,339
Orang itu adalah Hashira?

61
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,773
Lezat!

62
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:08,041
Dia jelas bukan orang biasa ...

63
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:08,509
Lezat!

64
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:10,644
Lezat!

65
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,147
Maaf, maaf mengganggu ...

66
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:15,415
Lezat!

67
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:16,450
Rengoku ...

68
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:18,786
Lezat!

69
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:22,523
Saya pikir ini sudah cukup jelas ...

70
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:32,533
Kaulah yang dulu bersama Master Ubuyashiki.

71
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:33,867
Iya.

72
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,435
Saya Kamado Tanjiro.

73
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,538
Orang-orang ini juga anggota dari Demon Slayer Corp.

74
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,106
Ini adalah teman-temanku-

75
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:39,506
ini Zenitsu dan

76
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,475
di sebelahnya adalah seorang pria bernama Inosuke!

77
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,110
Baik.

78
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:45,779
Konon, iblis di dalam kotak itu adalah ...

79
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:49,116
Ya, itu adikku, Nezuko.

80
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,453
Setan saat itu

81
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:55,022
menunjukkan sesuatu yang disetujui oleh Guru.

82
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:56,857
Kami dalam hal ini bersama-sama.

83
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,362
Ayo, duduk.

84
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,704
Luar biasa! 
Luar biasa!

85
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,272
Perut Pemiliknya luar biasa!

86
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,974
Berhenti, kamu akan memecahkan kaca!

87
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,809
Harap coba aman!

88
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,945
Kenapa kamu di kereta ini?

89
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,880
Apakah kamu punya misi?

90
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,149
Kami menerima pesanan dari Gagak.

91
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,749


92
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:25,452
Kami diberitahu bahwa korban dari Kereta Tak Terbatas terus meningkat.

93
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,287
Kami diperintahkan ke tempat ini terjadi.

94
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:29,523
Untuk bertemu denganmu secepat mungkin.

95
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,859
Jadi, ternyata begini.

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,893
Oke!

97
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:33,760
Iya.

98
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:37,331
Saya ingin menanyakan satu hal lagi ...

99
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,367
Saya ingin bertanya sendiri.

100
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,136
Apa masalahnya? 
Katakan padaku.

101
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,873
Ini tentang ayahku.

102
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:47,641
Apa yang terjadi dengan ayahmu?

103
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:50,611
Dia selalu lemah dan sakit.

104
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:51,945
Lemah dan sakit?

105
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,680
Walaupun demikian...

106
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,749
... di salju yang cukup untuk membekukan paru-paru

107
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,017
dia akan melakukan tarian Kagura sepanjang malam.

108
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:58,452
Beruntung sekali!

109
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:01,822
Sehingga-

110
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:02,689
Apa itu!

111
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,660
Tarian Dewa Api

112
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:08,896
dalam skenario hidup dan mati ...

113
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,431
Saya ingat tarian Kagura yang saya lihat ketika saya masih kecil.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,501
Jika Anda tahu sesuatu, Tn. Flame Hashira

115
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,638
Saya berharap Anda bisa memberi tahu saya.

116
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,346
Saya tidak tahu apa-apa!

117
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,983
Ini pertama kalinya aku mendengar tentang Kagura untuk Dewa Api.

118
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,320
Tarian Kagura yang dibawakan oleh ayahmu

119
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:34,921
bisa digunakan dalam pertempuran.

120
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,523
Itu sangat bagus.

121
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,825
Sepertinya topik ini sudah banyak dibahas.

122
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,894
Maaf, bisakah Anda mengatakan lebih banyak?

123
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,330
Jadilah muridku!

124
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,698
Aku akan menjagamu dengan baik!

125
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:45,832
Mohon tunggu!

126
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,502
Dimana kamu melihat 
Dengan siapa Anda berbicara?

127
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:51,371
Sungguh orang yang aneh ...

128
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:53,674
Flame Breathing memiliki sejarah panjang.

129
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:56,109
Seorang pendekar pedang yang menggunakan Api dan Air

130
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:57,311
terlepas dari jamannya

131
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:59,112
harus menjadi Pilar.

132
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:00,948
Api.

133
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:02,182
Air.

134
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:03,583
Angin.

135
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:04,952
Batu.

136
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:06,186
Guntur.

137
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,955
Ini adalah bentuk pernapasan utama.

138
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,490
Semua bentuk lainnya

139
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,893
berasal dari cabangnya.

140
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,796
Misalnya, Kabut diturunkan dari Angin.

141
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:17,731
Pendekar pemula

142
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,067
apa warna pedangmu?

143
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,536
Maaf, nama saya Tanjiro.

144
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,237
Warna pedangku adalah hitam.

145
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:25,539
Pedang hitam.

146
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,441
Ini masalah besar!

147
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:30,611
Apakah ini sangat buruk?

148
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:32,145
Saya belum pernah mendengar itu sebelumnya

149
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:34,214
seseorang dengan pedang hitam menjadi Pilar.

150
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:35,349
Sampai hari ini

151
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,316
tidak ada yang pernah mendengar hal seperti itu.

152
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:38,585
Bentuk apa yang akan menjadi spesialisasi Anda?

153
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:42,756
Belajarlah dari saya!

154
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:44,458
Kamu tidak akan kecewa!

155
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,226
Itu bukanlah apa yang saya maksud!

156
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:48,495
Dan dimana yang kamu lihat? 
Dengan siapa Anda berbicara?

157
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,170
Dia aneh

158
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,172
tapi dia juga orang baik yang memperhatikan orang lain.

159
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,442
Dari baunya dia memiliki rasa keadilan yang kuat.

160
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:06,613
Ini bagus!

161
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,815
Sangat cepat!

162
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:11,585
Itu berbahaya, bodoh!

163
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:13,220
Saya ingin keluar dan berlari di sampingnya!

164
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,422
Mari kita lihat siapa yang berlari lebih cepat!

165
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:17,858
Harus ada batasan untuk kebodohanmu!

166
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,059
Kami berada dalam situasi berbahaya.

167
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:21,962
Kami tidak tahu kapan iblis akan muncul.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,067
Benarkah itu?

169
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,202
Apakah setan benar-benar muncul di kereta ini?

170
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:30,404
Mereka punya.

171
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,872
Mereka benar-benar punya?

172
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:33,273
Saya tidak ingin menjadi seperti itu

173
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,042
di kereta dengan setan!

174
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:36,810
Ada setan di kereta ini!

175
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:37,944
Ahhh!

176
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,414
Saya ingin turun!

177
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:41,948
Dalam waktu singkat

178
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:42,949
di kereta ini

179
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,385
lebih dari empat puluh orang hilang.

180
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,921
Banyak pendekar pedang telah dikirim ke kereta ini

181
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,756
tapi semuanya hilang.

182
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:52,826
Sebagai Pilar, saya telah dipanggil untuk menyelidiki.

183
00:09:58,866 --> 00:09:59,933
Kenapa selalu seperti ini!

184
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:03,470
Saya ingin turun! 
Lepaskan aku!

185
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:15,749
Mohon tunjukkan tiket Anda.

186
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,285
Apa yang dia lakukan?

187
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,720
Konduktor ingin memastikan tiket Anda asli.

188
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,422
Dia akan menandai tiket Anda.

189
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,135
Ini dia...

190
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,260
Apa yang terjadi?

191
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:02,629
Ada bau yang menjijikkan ...

192
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:05,765
Terima kasih...

193
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,301
Saya mengkonfirmasi ...

194
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:13,607
Konduktor-

195
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,842
berbahaya di sini, tolong evakuasi daerah itu.

196
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,711
Situasinya sangat mendesak

197
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,046
tolong tidak keberatan saya membawa pedang.

198
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:43,703
Anda menggunakan Blood Arts untuk menyembunyikan tubuh besar ini?

199
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,072
Tidak heran sulit untuk mendeteksi Anda.

200
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,075
Tapi

201
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,945
karena Anda berusaha membunuh orang yang tidak bersalah

202
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,116
pedang yang menyala ini di tanganku

203
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:58,952
akan menghancurkanmu.

204
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,861
Flame Breathing! 
Formulir Pertama!

205
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,073
Api Tidak Mengetahui!

206
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,151
Luar biasa!

207
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,153
Dia merawat iblis itu seperti tidak ada apa-apanya!

208
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:38,325
Ada iblis lain di sini.

209
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,726
Aku datang!

210
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,000
Jangan tinggalkan aku!

211
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,788
Aku tidak akan membiarkanmu menyakiti manusia itu.

212
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,862
Apakah kamu tidak mendengar apa yang baru saja saya katakan?

213
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,465
Lawanmu ada di sini.

214
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,267
Apa-apaan itu?

215
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:23,270
Tangannya panjang? 
Tangannya sangat panjang!

216
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,839
Lihat saya! 
Aku duluan!

217
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,208
Tunggu sebentar, masih ada orang yang belum kabur!

218
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:31,511
Hanya harus membunuh iblis itu dan semuanya baik-baik saja!

219
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:47,794
The carriage behind us is safe.

220
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:48,461
Go.

221
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:51,965
Now there are no problems.

222
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,767
Let's end this quickly.

223
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,779
Flame Breathing!
Second Form!

224
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,584
Rising Scorching Sun!

225
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:35,108
Too...

226
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,510
He's so strong!

227
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,479
Superb swordsmanship!

228
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,815
Please accept me as a disciple!

229
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:42,949
Of course, no problem!

230
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,551
I'll train you to become a great swordsman!

231
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,686
I also want-

232
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,189
Okay, I'll take all three of you!

233
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,092
Rengoku is our teacher!

234
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:55,962
Teacher!

235
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,099
Teacher...!

236
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,673
I did as you ordered!

237
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,942
I cut the ticket and let them fall asleep!

238
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,477
Please!

239
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,846
Let me go to sleep!

240
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:51,217
Please let me meet my dead wife and daughter!

241
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,187
Please!

242
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:57,023
Please...

243
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:58,725
Okay.

244
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,665
You've done very well...

245
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,437
Fall asleep...

246
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,409
Have a dream of meeting your family.

247
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:18,945
Your Grace...

248
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,417
what should we do?

249
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:29,422
Wait a while, they will fall asleep.

250
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,925
Wait here before that.

251
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,594
These are intelligent demon slayers.

252
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,930
Sometimes when a person with murderous intent draws close

253
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:38,965
they will wake up again unconsciously.

254
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,001
When you get close enough to tie the rope

255
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:43,269
be careful not to touch them.

256
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,271
Because of where these demon slayers are

257
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:48,675
I can't leave the front carriage.

258
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:51,444
Before I am ready

259
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,879
perform your duties well.

260
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:56,950
All that matters is to dream of happiness.

261
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,351
Yes.

262
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,577
What happened... what happened?

263
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:07,120
Calm down, calm down.

264
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:09,589
You must be calm.

265
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:22,936
It's brother!

266
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,471
Brother, you're back!

267
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,273
Did you sell all of the charcoal?

268
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,392
Brother?

269
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:02,976
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry!

270
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:15,388
To die in a sweet dream...

271
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,890
what a wonderful thing.

272
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:20,360
Even if it is a powerful demon slayer

273
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:22,228
there are no exceptions.

274
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:26,633
The driving force of mankind is the mind...

275
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,301
...and the spirit.

276
00:19:31,472 --> 00:19:33,006
Just destroy the spiritual core

277
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,874
and everything is done.

278
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,777
They are so easy to kill

279
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:40,480
the human heart is the same no matter who it is.

280
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,650
They are all so fragile

281
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:46,552
like glass.

282
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,823
The rope should be tied to the wrist.

283
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:52,358
Is this the right way?

284
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,559
Yes.

285
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,029
Don't forget what he told us.

286
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,373
Breathe slowly.

287
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,677
Count in your heart.

288
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,881
You can fall into deep sleep by doing this.

289
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:26,225
Three, four, five, six...

290
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,267
Then, my brother burst into tears!

291
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,069
It shocked me!

292
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,671
He's so strange!

293
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,809
Maybe it’s because I’m too tired.

294
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,477
No need to make a fuss.

295
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:45,778
I'm fine.

296
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:51,451
Did you catch a cold?
Do you have a fever?

297
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:53,619
Don't push yourself.

298
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,588
Rest at home today.

299
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:57,724
I'm really fine.

300
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,058
Are you really okay?

301
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:01,928
Would you like to make a dumpling?

302
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,432
Stop playing around!

303
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:08,267
Really?

304
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,902
If you don't like it just say so!

305
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:17,043
I feel like I was having a nightmare.

306
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,015
Go to sleep, sleep quietly.

307
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:26,085
Forget breathing, sleep quietly.

308
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:29,756
Even if a demon comes, sleep quietly.

309
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:33,693
Sleep quietly even in your heart.

310
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:37,163
They seem very happy.

311
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:40,099
They should all be having pleasant dreams.

312
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,371
Fall gently.

313
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,974
Fall gently.

314
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,276
Fall into a dream.

315
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,484
Fall into a deep sleep.

316
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:04,757
I can't wake up from my dream anymore.

317
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,034
Come here!

318
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,303
The peaches here are delicious.

319
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:19,572
They're blooming with white clover flowers.

320
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,741
I will make a beautiful wreath for you.

321
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:24,143
I really know how to make wreaths.

322
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:25,678
How about it, Nezuko?

323
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,815
I'd like to make a lot of them!

324
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:30,683
Zenitsu!

325
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:39,091
There's a small river half-way

326
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:41,294
but don't worry, it's very shallow!

327
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:42,795
Small river?

328
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,465
Zenitsu, I don't know...

329
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,435
I was never taught how to swim.

330
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,306
It's okay!
Just hop on my back and we'll both cross!

331
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:55,041
It's just a small river!

332
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:57,276
I won't allow any water to get on Nezuko!

333
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,581
Leave everything to me!

334
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:02,048
Leave everything to me!

335
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:02,448
Just leave it to me!

336
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,852
Look at me!

337
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,535
Expedition team!
Cave expedition team!

338
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:28,140
We are the cave expedition team!

339
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:29,909
Discovery team!

340
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,978
Boss!

341
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:33,446
What's the matter?

342
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:35,448
Tell me, what did you find?

343
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,085
(Tanjiro)
There is a very strong smell of the cave owner!

344
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,086
Bump!

345
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,589
(Zenitsu)
I also heard him screaming, tweeting!

346
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:50,029
Really?
In this place?

347
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:53,099
Okay, let's go to battle!

348
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,567
Obey, boss!

349
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,302
What are you doing?

350
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:58,271
Don't go ahead, fight as three!

351
00:23:58,705 --> 00:23:59,538
Come here!

352
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,974
Look!
I give you bright acorns!

353
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:02,842
Do you see?

354
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:04,477
Attack!

355
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,475
What am I here for?

356
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:41,614
That's right.

357
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,016
Report to my Father.

358
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,552
To become a Pillar.

359
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,741
What's so great about being alive?

360
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:14,981
It's all boring.

361
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:16,482
It's not my business.

362
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,619
Anyway, it doesn't matter if it's you or me.

363
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,624
Everyone does what they can to get ahead.

364
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,198
Older brother!

365
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,769
Is Father happy for you?

366
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:40,539
If I become like you

367
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:43,743
will father also recognize me?

368
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,447
He didn't used to be like that.

369
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,119
Father could have been a Pillar of the Demon Slayer Corp.

370
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,055
He was originally a passionate person.

371
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,326
Then one day, he suddenly gave up.

372
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:02,728
Suddenly.

373
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:05,364
The one who did his best

374
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,067
who was passionate and nurtured us.

375
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,105
Why?

376
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:18,911
Don't think about things that you can't change.

377
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:23,049
I still feel sorry for Senjuro.

378
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:27,186
His mother who died of illness

379
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,687
that he has no memory of.

380
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:31,323
There's nothing he can do about that.

381
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:38,064
To be honest with you,

382
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:41,600
Father is not happy for me.

383
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,903
He doesn't care about me.

384
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:45,905
However,

385
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,708
your older brother will not lose his enthusiasm because of this.

386
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,710
The flame in my heart never goes out.

387
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:54,547
I will never become frustrated.

388
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,482
Senjuro,

389
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,487
you are different from me.

390
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,023
You have your older brother.

391
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,926
And he believes in his younger brother.

392
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,695
No matter which way you go,

393
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,797
you can become a great person.

394
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:14,734
Have a burning passion in your heart!

395
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:17,570
You have to work hard to live!

396
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,039
Don't lose faith!

397
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:29,081
Ah, this feels good.

398
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,584
Those ropes I made

399
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:33,586
allow someone to invade the dream of the person tied to it.

400
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:35,688
It's a special technique.

401
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,189
In every circumstance

402
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,292
I face the enemy very carefully.

403
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:43,028
Just fall asleep.

404
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,530
Whether they are great or insignificant

405
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:46,599
they will be like babies.

406
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:48,000
A delicious meal.

407
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,202
I just have to wait for those demon slayers to be dealt with...

408
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,371
...taste slowly.

409
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:03,015
No need to swing the sword so rigidly.

410
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,151
Relax your shoulders.

411
00:28:05,152 --> 00:28:05,784
The power resides in your shoulders.

412
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,287
Is that so?

413
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:09,355
Yes.

414
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,492
It's dangerous over there, that's the master of the body.

415
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:16,395
I have to be careful not to be found by him.

416
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:19,565
Find the boundary of the dream.

417
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,767
Faster!

418
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:27,006
The dreams I make are not endless

419
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:30,209
but centered on the dreamer.

420
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,711
A circle appears around the master of the body.

421
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:36,849
Beyond the dream is a special field without consciousness.

422
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,919
The spiritual core is hidden there.

423
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:43,289
Your job is to destroy the core.

424
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,692
In this way, the owner of the dreamland

425
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:48,894
will become a waste.

426
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,670
Found it!

427
00:28:58,205 --> 00:29:00,172
Although the scenery continues...

428
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,707
I can't move forward.

429
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,113
I must quickly destroy the spiritual core of this person.

430
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:14,720
I also have a dream to make myself happy.

431
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:27,066
What a strange unconsciousness

432
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:28,868
it's so hot.

433
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,703
It's actually burning.

434
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:32,671
Have to hurry.

435
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:50,589
Finally found it!

436
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,024
Is this the spiritual core?

437
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:56,795
Seeing this for the first time.

438
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,735
I just have to destroy it...

439
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:04,236
...then I can!

440
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:30,162
When people fall into this sleep

441
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,231
they shouldn't be able to move at all!

442
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:33,766
How is this possible?

443
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:40,139
What an amazing survival instinct!

444
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:48,414
Tanjiro.

445
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:50,749
Today, Mother is going to make your favorite food.

446
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,917
I'm sure you'll like it!

447
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,622
Wait, I'll mash the leftover mochi right away.

448
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:58,157
Awesome!

449
00:30:58,158 --> 00:30:59,658
Mother wants to bake senbei!

450
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:00,893
Not fair!

451
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,061
I also like senbei!

452
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:04,129
We're brothers, you know?

453
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:05,564
I would also like some senbei!

454
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:06,298
Me too!

455
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,599
So

456
00:31:07,634 --> 00:31:09,368
let's eat together!

457
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:11,236
Can you help your mother get the cooking net?

458
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,371
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!

459
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,274
I will mash the mochi with a grinder!

460
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:17,976
Oh, look the beggar is here to help!

461
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,578
I also want to help!

462
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:22,114
You're gonna be held responsible for eating that later!

463
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:23,949
What a thief!

464
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,134
Nezuko, let's go.

465
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,745
What did I just say?

466
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:56,782
I'm back!

467
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:00,319
Welcome back.

468
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:02,888
I'm back.

469
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,125
Welcome back, brother.

470
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:11,663
Huh, where is Nezuko?

471
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:14,666
Sister just went to the mountain to pick wild vegetables.

472
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:16,668
It's daytime!

473
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,939
Is that not okay?

474
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,375
Is that...

475
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:24,810
Strange.

476
00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:27,946
Tanjirou, can you boil the bath water for me?

477
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:30,549
The kitchen is still busy for now.

478
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:36,288
I'm saying strange things.

479
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,091
Is it because I'm tired?

480
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,100
Strange, it disappeared.

481
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:51,570
What happened just now?

482
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:55,174
I seemed to have... seen a box?

483
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,579
An illusion caused by the snow?

484
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,683
Wake up soon!

485
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:08,987
Wake up!

486
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,761
Wake up soon, everyone is attacked!

487
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,664
It's a dream, this is just a dream!

488
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,165
Wake up soon!

489
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,633
That's it!

490
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:22,768
Yeah, I'm...

491
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:25,704
I should be on the train!

492
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:28,006
Wake up and fight!

493
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:29,875
Hurry up and fight!

494
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,078
Fight fast!

495
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:40,085
Brother, can you give me your pickled radish?

496
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,386
Just say no!

497
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:43,088
You can't do this every time!

498
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,356
Why is it always like this!

499
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,991
Grabbing something from brother!

500
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,459
You're annoying!

501
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,261
You already have another bowl of rice!

502
00:33:49,262 --> 00:33:49,661


503
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,065
I didn't wake up.

504
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:53,699
I didn't wake up!

505
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,500


506
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:55,501
I'm still in the dream!

507
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:57,803
What do I have to do to leave?

508
00:33:58,004 --> 00:33:59,938
I just figured out this is a dream!

509
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:02,875
What do I do?

510
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,895
I have to wake up!

511
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:01,867
Brother!

512
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:03,435
You're catching on fire!

513
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:08,740
It's the smell of Nezuko.

514
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:10,709
Nezuko is bleeding!

515
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:13,679


516
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,287
My demon slayer uniform.

517
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,289
I'm aware now.

518
00:35:24,991 --> 00:35:27,960
Waking up little by little.

519
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:29,795
What happened?

520
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,797
Brother, are you okay?

521
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:32,998
Brother?

522
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,868
Sorry... I have to go.

523
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:43,208
I can't come back.

524
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:46,745
I'm so sorry.

525
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:49,748
Brother!

526
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:50,415
Brother!

527
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:58,423
If the demon that made me dream is nearby

528
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:02,027
you have to find him as soon as possible and get rid of him.

529
00:36:03,863 --> 00:36:06,298
Find out where...

530
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:10,869
Brother, where are you going?

531
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:21,346
I picked a lot of wild vegetables on the mountain today.

532
00:36:25,785 --> 00:36:27,786
Mother, over here!

533
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:30,255
Brother suddenly caught on fire!

534
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,593
Mother?

535
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,729
Tanjiro, are you okay?

536
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:39,831
Older brother...

537
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:48,540
What's wrong, Tanjiro?

538
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,842
What is that uniform you're wearing?

539
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:05,257
I really want to stay in this place forever.

540
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,829
I really want to go back.

541
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,632
If this is real

542
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:16,501
I will live with everyone like this.

543
00:37:17,003 --> 00:37:18,236
On this mountain.

544
00:37:20,173 --> 00:37:21,506
If this is real

545
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:24,209
everyone is doing well now.

546
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:29,247
Nezuko can walk in the sunlight,

547
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:30,916
walk under the clear sky.

548
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:31,483


549
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:37,456
If this is real

550
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:41,660
I will burn charcoal as usual today.

551
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:44,963
It would be impossible to have a sword.

552
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:53,872
If this is real...

553
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:10,155
But I have lost them.

554
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:12,224
It's impossible to go back.

555
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:16,895
Brother, don't you want us!

556
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:20,532
Brother, don't leave us!

557
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:27,572
Sorry!

558
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:29,941
Sorry, Mother!

559
00:38:31,944 --> 00:38:34,579
I can't be with you anymore!

560
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:39,951
But I will always miss you in my heart!

561
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,955
I will miss each of you!

562
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:49,528
Thank you for everything...

563
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:53,131
I wish I could apologize to you all...

564
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,300
I have not forgotten you!

565
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:59,271
No matter what, you are in my heart!

566
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,439
So please...

567
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,842
Please forgive me!

568
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:15,153
I must quickly destroy his spiritual core.

569
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:36,541
Here is his heart.

570
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:41,046
How can it be so beautiful?

571
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:44,249
This vast expanse?

572
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,420
So warm...

573
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:02,067
Where is the spiritual core?

574
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:05,837
This unconsciousness...

575
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,839
what exactly is going on?

576
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:12,878
Speaking of which, that crazy boar that makes me feel sick.

577
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:16,147
What's wrong with him?

578
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,123
Why is he here?

579
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:27,259
Perverted naked boar!

580
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:39,738
Dark...

581
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:44,209
It's so dark you can't see anything.

582
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,744
How annoying.

583
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,846
The unconsciousness of this blonde kid.

584
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,447
It's too ridiculous.

585
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:51,383
I'll have to use my hands

586
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:54,219
to find where the spiritual core is?

587
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:56,588
What a joke.

588
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:00,425
Huh...?

589
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:13,171
Why would a disgusting man come here?

590
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:15,173
What a damn pest.

591
00:41:15,374 --> 00:41:16,575
The only one who can come here

592
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,410
is Nezuko!

593
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,647
I am going to kill you.

594
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,217
Where is Nezuko?

595
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:27,786
How would I know?

596
00:41:27,787 --> 00:41:29,087
So...

597
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:30,388
Die!

598
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:30,922
Die!

599
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:36,227
Do not come...!

600
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,668
Is someone in trouble?

601
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,837
What's happened?

602
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:47,973
How have they connected

603
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:49,741
and their spiritual cores not been destroyed yet?

604
00:41:51,377 --> 00:41:53,578
Ah well... that's fine.

605
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,647
They've given me enough time.

606
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:01,886
Not here.

607
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:04,456
Although, there is a very faint strange smell.

608
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:06,458
What is this feeling?

609
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,493
As if I'm covered with a film?

610
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:12,263
The faint smell of a demon coming from all sides.

611
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:14,499
But there is no way to determine the location.

612
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,501
I have to get out as soon as possible!

613
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,970
Nezuko is bleeding.

614
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:21,640
If everyone else fell asleep too

615
00:42:21,641 --> 00:42:23,308
it means the situation is very bad.

616
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:25,377
What to do?

617
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:29,948
Could it be...  I'm not using Total Concentration Breathing?

618
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:33,518
Am I just asleep now?

619
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:36,655
Tanjiro.

620
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:43,361
Raise your sword.

621
00:42:44,964 --> 00:42:48,233
The things that must be cut are already here.

622
00:42:58,511 --> 00:43:02,680
Must be... here.

623
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:06,251
In order to wake up

624
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,620
what do i have to cut?

625
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,423
I think I know.

626
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:14,793
But, in case you get it wrong

627
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:17,095
what happened in the dream

628
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:18,897
if it affects reality

629
00:43:19,832 --> 00:43:21,666
will be irreparable.

630
00:43:24,236 --> 00:43:25,470
Do not hesitate.

631
00:43:25,471 --> 00:43:26,604
Hands on!

632
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:27,906
Just do it!

633
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,209
Death in dreams can be connected to sobriety in reality!

634
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:32,644
In other words

635
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:35,680
I must do this!

636
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,718
Cut... your neck!

637
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,538
I'm fine, I'm still alive.

638
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:07,212
Nezuko, are you okay?

639
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:11,850
Nezuko.

640
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:14,686
Zenitsu.

641
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:16,488
Inosuke.

642
00:44:17,223 --> 00:44:18,523
Rengoku.

643
00:44:22,762 --> 00:44:24,562
Who are these people?

644
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:28,233
Tied our wrists with a rope?

645
00:44:29,435 --> 00:44:30,702
Rope.

646
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:34,839
How is this...

647
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:36,574
The rope was burned.

648
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:38,710
Did Nezuko burn the rope?

649
00:44:39,378 --> 00:44:41,679
There's a faint smell of a demon.

650
00:44:43,883 --> 00:44:46,284
Is this smell also on the ticket?

651
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:48,620
As I thought.

652
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:51,189
There is also the faint smell of a demon on it.

653
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:54,092
I must have been hypnotized when the ticket was cut.

654
00:44:54,894 --> 00:44:57,028
This ticket was touch by a demon.

655
00:44:57,563 --> 00:44:59,531
Such a subtle smell.

656
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:02,534
What could perform such a powerful Blood Arts technique?

657
00:45:05,171 --> 00:45:06,437
What has happened here?

658
00:45:07,106 --> 00:45:09,841
I think it's best to not use a sword for this.

659
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:11,442
To burn this rope.

660
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:15,146
Nezuko, please.

661
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,749
Help everyone by burning the ropes!

662
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:27,592
Zenitsu, wake up!

663
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,360
Wake up, Zenitsu!

664
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:30,662
Wake up quickly!

665
00:45:33,432 --> 00:45:35,733
Wake up quickly, Inosuke, please!

666
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:38,236
Inosuke!

667
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:42,106
Great job.

668
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:43,141
I'm sorry.

669
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:44,842
Thank you.

670
00:45:45,277 --> 00:45:46,844
Nezuko you're doing very well.

671
00:45:50,282 --> 00:45:52,617
They still can't wake up.

672
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:54,986
What do I do?

673
00:45:58,224 --> 00:45:59,057
Rengo-

674
00:46:02,628 --> 00:46:03,595
What are you doing?

675
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:09,300
Is this girl controlled by a demon?

676
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:11,302
Don't try to stop me!

677
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,238
I blame you people for coming!

678
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:15,473
Stopping me from having a good dream!

679
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,477
She is voluntarily...

680
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:22,880
This person too.

681
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:27,919
Why are you still in a daze?

682
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,188
If you're awake, hurry up and help!

683
00:46:30,923 --> 00:46:33,258
I don't care if you're sick or whatever!

684
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:34,659
If you don't do things well

685
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,994
I'm going to tell that-

686
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:37,262
Tell him not to let you dream!

687
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:38,563
Did you hear me?

688
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:44,302
Was he the one tied to me?

689
00:46:45,204 --> 00:46:46,571
Tuberculosis.

690
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:48,006
He is sick.

691
00:46:48,641 --> 00:46:49,073
Really bad, too.

692
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:52,844
I can't forgive this demon.

693
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:55,713
Taking this opportunity to control people.

694
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,350
Sorry.

695
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:02,654
I must leave you right now.

696
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,339
You wanted to stay in a happy dream, I know.

697
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:23,374
I know.

698
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,679
I also wanted to stay in my dream.

699
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:36,087
Even if it was a dream.

700
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:47,832
I thought

701
00:47:48,434 --> 00:47:51,035
as long as I can escape the pain caused by my illness

702
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:55,073
it doesn't matter if I hurt people.

703
00:47:57,142 --> 00:47:58,776
But in your dream

704
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:02,714
it was so warm.

705
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,885
You should be the embodiment of this person's soul.

706
00:48:11,724 --> 00:48:14,792
It is very clear and transparent, it feels so comfortable.

707
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:25,436
This is the spiritual core?

708
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:28,106
Why bring me here?

709
00:48:32,311 --> 00:48:34,112
You know i'm looking for this?

710
00:48:34,446 --> 00:48:36,014
Did you bring me here?

711
00:48:42,054 --> 00:48:43,521
How could this be?

712
00:48:44,223 --> 00:48:46,924
I'm here to destroy the spiritual core.

713
00:48:47,693 --> 00:48:49,127
Why?

714
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:53,431
Those shining souls in your heart.

715
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:56,467
Illuminated my painful and twisted heart.

716
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:01,105
Did I help you?

717
00:49:03,842 --> 00:49:04,976
Thank you.

718
00:49:07,146 --> 00:49:08,346
You must be careful.

719
00:49:12,418 --> 00:49:13,317
Right.

720
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:14,786
Nezuko!

721
00:49:26,832 --> 00:49:28,533
Such a strong smell.

722
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:30,101
So heavy.

723
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,736
In such a strong wind,

724
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,504
the smell of this demon is still so strong.

725
00:49:34,506 --> 00:49:36,574
I can still fall asleep in this state.

726
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:40,311
Although the carriage is indeed a confined space.

727
00:49:40,879 --> 00:49:42,346
I can't believe it

728
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:44,282
I'm so useless.

729
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:46,584
The demon is upwind.

730
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:48,586
Is he in the front carriage?

731
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:53,958
Nezuko, don't follow me!

732
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,860
It's dangerous outside, stay inside!

733
00:49:56,128 --> 00:49:57,428
Wake everyone up!

734
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:07,538
Oh, you woke up.

735
00:50:08,273 --> 00:50:09,474
Good morning!

736
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:13,511
If only you stayed asleep.

737
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:16,113
Is it this guy...?

738
00:50:17,483 --> 00:50:19,350
Why wake up?

739
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:23,488
I made you have such a wonderful dream.

740
00:50:24,423 --> 00:50:26,524
If I feel like it

741
00:50:26,525 --> 00:50:29,994
I could also make you dream
of your family being murdered.

742
00:50:30,562 --> 00:50:33,030
Do you prefer to have that kind of dream?

743
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,600
I don't think so, it's too painful.

744
00:50:38,971 --> 00:50:40,471
Then this time

745
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:44,442
I will let you have it. Your father's dream
of coming back from the dead is over.

746
00:50:54,553 --> 00:50:55,720
Actually, I...

747
00:50:56,488 --> 00:50:59,490
I like to make people have pleasant dreams.

748
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:02,460
Then the nightmare will follow.

749
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:05,530
I like to see human beings in pain.

750
00:51:05,531 --> 00:51:07,431
Their distorted expressions.

751
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:10,401
I can't stop.

752
00:51:11,036 --> 00:51:13,437
Seeing those being crushed by misfortune.

753
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:16,874
The poor guy struggling with pain.

754
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:19,377
It's so fascinating.

755
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:23,147
However, I won't be careless.

756
00:51:23,282 --> 00:51:25,016
Even if it takes a little more work

757
00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:28,152
I will definitely kill you demon slayers.

758
00:51:28,654 --> 00:51:32,590
The ink of those tickets were mixed with my blood.

759
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:35,693
As long as the Conductor is checking

760
00:51:35,761 --> 00:51:37,695
cuts the ticket and leaves a gap

761
00:51:38,797 --> 00:51:41,132
it will automatically start the process.

762
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:46,270
But it's weird.

763
00:51:46,939 --> 00:51:49,273
Why did this one wake up?

764
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:53,578
He saw through the technique in such a short time.

765
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,380
Don't you want to have pleasant dreams?

766
00:51:56,582 --> 00:51:58,583
Have the dreams you want?

767
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:00,718
Human desire in this respect

768
00:52:02,588 --> 00:52:05,189
is obviously very strong.

769
00:52:07,993 --> 00:52:10,962
Don't enter into someone else's heart without permission!

770
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:15,433
I can't spare you!

771
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,938
He has earrings on his ears?

772
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,944
I am blessed with good fortune!

773
00:52:27,112 --> 00:52:30,214
He was delivered to me so soon!

774
00:52:30,682 --> 00:52:32,850
Like in a dream.

775
00:52:32,851 --> 00:52:34,719
Soon I can have more...

776
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,188
more of the blood bestowed by Master Muzan!

777
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:41,392
Then after I become stronger

778
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:46,063
I can request to take part in the battle to replace a Waxing Moon!

779
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,568
Water Breathing!

780
00:52:52,137 --> 00:52:53,404
Tenth Form!

781
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,906
Perpetual Cycle of Death and Rebirth!

782
00:53:01,113 --> 00:53:02,546
Blood Arts!

783
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:08,986
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis!

784
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:12,390
Go to sleep.

785
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,967
He's not asleep?

786
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,740
Go to sleep!

787
00:53:37,015 --> 00:53:38,182
Go to sleep!

788
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,920
Go to sleep!

789
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:43,454
Go to sleep!

790
00:53:47,092 --> 00:53:52,730
Go to sleep!

791
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,767
How could this be?

792
00:53:57,169 --> 00:53:59,270
Are my Blood Arts not effective?

793
00:53:59,705 --> 00:54:00,671
No, this one has fallen asleep several times.

794
00:54:00,672 --> 00:54:03,274
This one has undergone my hypnosis many times.

795
00:54:10,082 --> 00:54:11,315
The moment he was hypnotized

796
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:13,050
I could see my Blood Arts were effective.

797
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:18,689
Killing yourself to stay awake.

798
00:54:25,197 --> 00:54:26,630
Although in a dream

799
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,265
doing such a thing

800
00:54:29,301 --> 00:54:31,802
to kill oneself

801
00:54:32,704 --> 00:54:34,672
requires a lot of courage.

802
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,407
This kid

803
00:54:39,044 --> 00:54:40,611
he is not an ordinary person.

804
00:54:49,254 --> 00:54:54,525
Why is brother not coming to save us?

805
00:54:57,796 --> 00:54:59,930
When our family was killed

806
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:01,766
what were you doing?

807
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:08,405
Only brother survived.

808
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:19,183
What would I want with you

809
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,318
you trash.

810
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:31,996
Why didn't you die as well?

811
00:55:33,064 --> 00:55:36,567
How can you even live with yourself?

812
00:55:43,942 --> 00:55:46,644
My family would never say such things!

813
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:48,479
Don't mess with me!

814
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:54,885
You are not allowed to insult my family!

815
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:22,480
I didn't feel my blade hit him?

816
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:25,850
Is this also a dream?

817
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:29,787
Is this demon weaker than him?

818
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:33,324
Master said,

819
00:56:34,092 --> 00:56:36,827
"Kill the Pillar and the one who wears
hanafuda earrings."

820
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:38,696
Master's mood at that time...

821
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:43,234
...I understand it very well now!

822
00:56:44,102 --> 00:56:46,537
As long as you exist

823
00:56:47,138 --> 00:56:48,038
this fact alone

824
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:50,774
makes people very angry!

825
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:52,676
He's not dead

826
00:56:53,612 --> 00:56:55,846
Your expression is amazing!

827
00:56:56,615 --> 00:56:59,049
What I want to see most is your expression!

828
00:57:01,186 --> 00:57:03,988
"I clearly cut off his head, why can't he die?"

829
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:05,990
You want me to give you a reason.

830
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:08,993
Okay!
I happen to be very excited.

831
00:57:08,994 --> 00:57:10,861
I'm in a very good mood.

832
00:57:11,263 --> 00:57:12,897
The reason why is so simple

833
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:15,733
even a baby could understand.

834
00:57:17,502 --> 00:57:18,769
My original body is long gone.

835
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:20,938
Long gone.

836
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,475
This body is talking to you now

837
00:57:25,143 --> 00:57:26,477
and although it has the shape of a head

838
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:28,479
it is not the real head.

839
00:57:29,147 --> 00:57:32,082
While you were lying down and sleeping

840
00:57:32,918 --> 00:57:36,153
I merged with this train!

841
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:40,691
Everything about this train has become my body!

842
00:57:40,692 --> 00:57:41,825
My meat!

843
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,727
My bones!

844
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,797
Look at your expression.

845
00:57:47,065 --> 00:57:48,799
I should understand.

846
00:57:49,334 --> 00:57:50,467
In other words

847
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:53,938
more than two-hundred passengers on this train

848
00:57:54,172 --> 00:57:57,741
have all become food that will strengthen my body.

849
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,544
They are all my hostages.

850
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:03,380
Can you protect them?

851
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:04,982
You are alone.

852
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:07,351
This train runs from front to back.

853
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:10,854
So many innocent passengers.

854
00:58:11,923 --> 00:58:15,159
How would you feel handing them all over to me?

855
00:58:22,334 --> 00:58:24,468
What do I do?
What do I do?

856
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,805
I can only protect passengers in two carriages at most.

857
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:30,541
No amount of strength can guarantee everyone’s safety.

858
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:35,112
Rengoku, Zenitsu, Inosuke!

859
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:37,214
Stop sleeping!

860
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,583
Please wake up, please!

861
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:41,986
Nezuko!

862
00:58:41,987 --> 00:58:44,288
You have to protect those who are asleep!

863
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,901
Men, come with me!

864
00:58:58,169 --> 00:59:01,472
Look at me!
Explosive awakening!

865
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:05,009
The boar is advancing by leaps and bounds, Lord Inosuke is here!

866
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,212
The boar is advancing by leaps and bounds, Lord Inosuke is here!

867
00:59:08,613 --> 00:59:09,813
Inosuke!

868
00:59:09,981 --> 00:59:12,583
No place on this train is safe!

869
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:14,385
We want to protect those who fell asleep!

870
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:17,287
The whole train has completely turned into a demon!

871
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:18,655
Did you hear that?

872
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:20,824
This whole train is a demon!

873
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,660
I knew it.

874
00:59:23,695 --> 00:59:25,462
Exactly as I expected.

875
00:59:25,497 --> 00:59:27,498
The Master is very wise!

876
00:59:27,532 --> 00:59:28,599
It's so wise to say nothing!

877
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:29,867
It's so wise to say nothing!

878
00:59:34,372 --> 00:59:37,141
Beast Breathing!
Fifth Fang!

879
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:39,676
Crazy Cutting!

880
00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:46,316
Whether it's this guy or that guy

881
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:47,818
I will save them!

882
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:50,120
You all have a chance!

883
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:52,189
Worship me!

884
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,124
Your Lord, your Lord

885
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:56,226
Lord Inosuke!

886
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:58,829
Coming through!

887
00:59:59,531 --> 01:00:01,365
I have to save the passengers too.

888
01:00:02,133 --> 01:00:04,268
Since Inosuke is here now

889
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:06,203
I'll go ahead.

890
01:00:31,496 --> 01:00:33,530
This is what things have come to.

891
01:00:36,835 --> 01:00:37,801
Water Breathing!

892
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:39,570
First Form!

893
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,700
Surface Slash!

894
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:45,776
My attack had little effect.

895
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:47,544
The demon's body goes on endlessly.

896
01:00:48,279 --> 01:00:50,214
I have to stop it.

897
01:00:56,855 --> 01:00:58,756
The feeling of demon slayers

898
01:00:58,857 --> 01:01:02,059
running around in my own body.

899
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:06,130
I can’t believe that I will regenerate immediately.

900
01:01:06,464 --> 01:01:10,434
It won't stop until you are exhausted.

901
01:01:11,069 --> 01:01:12,903
My body slowly...

902
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:16,773
...attracts hundreds of passengers to eat up!

903
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:31,582
Thunder Breathing!
First Form!

904
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,318
Thunderclap and Flash!

905
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:38,889
Do not worry.

906
01:02:39,657 --> 01:02:42,926
Nezuko, I will protect you.

907
01:02:45,663 --> 01:02:47,864
Protect...

908
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:56,106
Was that thunder I heard?

909
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:57,641
Is it in the back carriages?

910
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,376
What is the situation of the front?

911
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,078
Is Rengoku awake?

912
01:03:01,813 --> 01:03:04,514
Where are you Rengoku, where are you Nezuko?

913
01:03:10,355 --> 01:03:12,990
I'm useless without knowing where they are.

914
01:03:14,026 --> 01:03:15,526
This isn't good,
what should I do?

915
01:03:15,694 --> 01:03:16,827
We need everyone working together!

916
01:03:17,629 --> 01:03:19,497
The passengers in the last car should be fine, right?

917
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:22,366
Damn it, this place is too small!

918
01:03:22,968 --> 01:03:26,070
I can't even swing my sword properly!

919
01:03:33,011 --> 01:03:34,845
I took a nap

920
01:03:34,846 --> 01:03:36,947
and look what happened.

921
01:03:37,816 --> 01:03:39,483
I didn't expect it, I didn't expect it.

922
01:03:40,352 --> 01:03:42,153
My Pillar is really useless...

923
01:03:44,156 --> 01:03:45,623
If there's a hole

924
01:03:47,726 --> 01:03:49,060
I would really like to go in!

925
01:03:56,234 --> 01:03:56,934
What was that?

926
01:04:03,175 --> 01:04:04,809
What happened just now?

927
01:04:04,843 --> 01:04:06,277
Was that the demon?

928
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:09,780
Novice swordsman!

929
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:12,917
Rengoku!

930
01:04:13,552 --> 01:04:14,685
Before coming here

931
01:04:14,686 --> 01:04:16,954
I used a flurry of attacks against the demon.

932
01:04:17,122 --> 01:04:19,423
It will take some time for the demon to regenerate.

933
01:04:19,991 --> 01:04:22,093
There is not much time, so I will make a long story short.

934
01:04:22,127 --> 01:04:22,927
Yes.

935
01:04:23,495 --> 01:04:25,363
The train has eight carriages.

936
01:04:25,564 --> 01:04:27,498
I'll protect the five carriages behind.

937
01:04:27,899 --> 01:04:29,100
The remaining three sections

938
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:31,836
are protected by the yellow-haired boy and your sister.

939
01:04:32,204 --> 01:04:33,537
You and the boar-head boy

940
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:35,940
pay attention to the condition of the three military compartments.

941
01:04:35,974 --> 01:04:37,708
Find the demon's neck.

942
01:04:37,943 --> 01:04:39,076
Neck?

943
01:04:39,211 --> 01:04:40,378
But this demon is already-

944
01:04:40,412 --> 01:04:42,146
No matter what shape it becomes

945
01:04:42,314 --> 01:04:44,515
As long as he is a demon, he has a neck!

946
01:04:44,683 --> 01:04:46,450
I will fight while looking for his vitals.

947
01:04:46,952 --> 01:04:48,586
You have to cheer up!

948
01:04:52,524 --> 01:04:54,859
He's so powerful.

949
01:04:54,893 --> 01:04:55,826
That was just now...

950
01:04:55,827 --> 01:04:57,962
The shaking was caused by Rengoku when he moved?

951
01:04:58,864 --> 01:05:01,165
The situation was so quickly grasped and judged.

952
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:04,034
One person, responsible for five carriages.

953
01:05:05,103 --> 01:05:07,371
Now is not the time to admire him, idiot!

954
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:08,839
Hurry up and do what must be done!

955
01:05:09,274 --> 01:05:11,575
The smell is getting stronger and stronger!

956
01:05:11,576 --> 01:05:12,710
I have to hurry!

957
01:05:14,646 --> 01:05:15,479
Inosuke!

958
01:05:15,514 --> 01:05:17,114
Inosuke, where are you?

959
01:05:17,149 --> 01:05:17,982
So noisy!

960
01:05:18,016 --> 01:05:19,183
I'll kill you again!

961
01:05:19,284 --> 01:05:20,184
Above me?

962
01:05:20,285 --> 01:05:22,820
Mr. Big Eyes trying to order me around!

963
01:05:25,023 --> 01:05:26,123
But he seems...

964
01:05:27,025 --> 01:05:27,858
...he seems

965
01:05:29,161 --> 01:05:30,694
...seems very powerful!

966
01:05:31,196 --> 01:05:32,663
Infuriating!

967
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:35,366
Inosuke!

968
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:37,601
We have to pay attention to the three cars ahead!

969
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:39,103
I know!

970
01:05:39,571 --> 01:05:41,372
And i have found!

971
01:05:41,706 --> 01:05:42,673
Found it long ago!

972
01:05:42,707 --> 01:05:44,475
Relying on myself

973
01:05:44,876 --> 01:05:46,710
I found the key to this master!

974
01:05:47,212 --> 01:05:48,045
You found it?

975
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,114
The key is really ahead?

976
01:05:50,182 --> 01:05:52,116
Yes, just ahead!

977
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,385
It's here in the front!

978
01:05:55,187 --> 01:05:57,254
Because the wind is too strong, the smell is blown away.

979
01:05:57,255 --> 01:05:58,622
It's hard for me to detect where it is.

980
01:05:58,857 --> 01:06:00,791
Since Inosuke said so, he must not be wrong.

981
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,127
Near the coal pile!

982
01:06:03,462 --> 01:06:04,528
I know!

983
01:06:04,529 --> 01:06:05,396
I know!

984
01:06:05,997 --> 01:06:07,398
Fine, let's go!

985
01:06:07,799 --> 01:06:08,899
Go ahead!

986
01:06:20,946 --> 01:06:22,446
Right here?

987
01:06:27,085 --> 01:06:27,818
Great!

988
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,260
Inosuke!

989
01:06:36,828 --> 01:06:39,530
Suspicious.

990
01:06:39,998 --> 01:06:41,532
Especially near where-

991
01:06:42,367 --> 01:06:43,367
What do you want to do?

992
01:06:43,401 --> 01:06:45,636
G-g-get out!

993
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:47,305
The demon's neck.

994
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:49,207
Demon.

995
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:50,708
Demon's critical spot!

996
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:51,175


997
01:06:55,915 --> 01:06:56,581
What in the-

998
01:06:57,249 --> 01:06:58,950
What the-

999
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,987
Too many hands!

1000
01:07:03,656 --> 01:07:04,622
Bad!

1001
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,994
Water Breathing!
Fourth Form!

1002
01:07:10,595 --> 01:07:11,963
Striking Tide!

1003
01:07:19,905 --> 01:07:21,306
Inosuke, are you okay?

1004
01:07:21,507 --> 01:07:24,008
I was not saved just because of you.

1005
01:07:24,043 --> 01:07:24,909
I know that.

1006
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,746
This...

1007
01:07:30,015 --> 01:07:31,382
Directly below...

1008
01:07:31,983 --> 01:07:33,384
Directly below here.

1009
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:35,152
The smell is very strong.

1010
01:07:35,588 --> 01:07:38,156
Inosuke, the ghost's neck is under here!

1011
01:07:38,357 --> 01:07:39,591
Don't order me

1012
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,259
I'm your boss!

1013
01:07:41,293 --> 01:07:42,226
I know that!

1014
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:43,761
Watch closely.

1015
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:47,198
Beast Breathing!
Second Form!

1016
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:50,535
Rip and Tear!

1017
01:07:56,775 --> 01:07:58,142
Is the bone...?

1018
01:07:58,210 --> 01:07:59,509
Is that the bones of the neck?

1019
01:08:00,278 --> 01:08:02,747
Water Breathing!
Eighth Form!

1020
01:08:03,248 --> 01:08:04,749
Waterfall Basin!

1021
01:08:08,821 --> 01:08:10,054
Blocked!

1022
01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:28,106
The incision healed quickly.

1023
01:08:28,507 --> 01:08:29,807
He regenerates quickly.

1024
01:08:30,576 --> 01:08:31,509
And

1025
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:32,643
trying my best

1026
01:08:32,678 --> 01:08:34,277
I barely saw his bones.

1027
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,714
You have to cut it off.

1028
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:38,415
Inosuke!

1029
01:08:38,817 --> 01:08:40,551
We're going to continuously attack
with our breathing forms!

1030
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,087
One person cuts the meat forward first.

1031
01:08:43,322 --> 01:08:45,189
The other cuts off the bone immediately after.

1032
01:08:45,457 --> 01:08:46,858
This could work.

1033
01:08:46,892 --> 01:08:49,594
Your method sounds like it will work,
I'll make sure to praise you for this!

1034
01:08:49,728 --> 01:08:50,695
Thank you!

1035
01:08:52,598 --> 01:08:53,631
Let's start.

1036
01:09:01,907 --> 01:09:04,142
Blood Arts...

1037
01:09:04,677 --> 01:09:05,943
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

1038
01:09:06,378 --> 01:09:07,779
This is Blood Arts!

1039
01:09:08,347 --> 01:09:11,015
I'm going to fall asleep.

1040
01:09:12,284 --> 01:09:15,253
Inosuke, cut your neck in his dream

1041
01:09:15,587 --> 01:09:17,188
so you can wake up!

1042
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:22,694
Nothing?

1043
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:24,962
If you beat him with that trick, you can beat his spell!

1044
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:28,766
Stupid!
Close your eyes immediately after you wake up!

1045
01:09:29,201 --> 01:09:30,735
Otherwise, you'll go back to where you started.

1046
01:09:32,438 --> 01:09:33,771
Good, I woke up.

1047
01:09:40,345 --> 01:09:41,713
The moment I wake up

1048
01:09:41,747 --> 01:09:44,615
the demon's eyes will be waiting for me!

1049
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,085
Keep your eyes closed when you wake up!

1050
01:09:47,586 --> 01:09:49,187
I want to close my eyes!

1051
01:09:51,457 --> 01:09:53,257
Not fast enough!

1052
01:09:53,959 --> 01:09:55,026
Faster!

1053
01:09:55,694 --> 01:09:56,360
Even faster!

1054
01:09:56,795 --> 01:09:57,595
Chop the neck!

1055
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,164
Chop...

1056
01:10:00,499 --> 01:10:01,999
Faster!

1057
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:04,869
Wake up!

1058
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:07,305
Wake up!

1059
01:10:11,677 --> 01:10:13,678
This is not a dream, this is reality!

1060
01:10:14,046 --> 01:10:15,880
Don't be fooled by his trap!

1061
01:10:16,215 --> 01:10:18,249
Don't be stupid, don't lose your life in vain!

1062
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:25,957
The Lord wears the headpiece of the master on the mountain.

1063
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,292
They're so horrible.

1064
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:28,927
They dare not look into my eyes at all!

1065
01:10:30,596 --> 01:10:32,664
Blind eyes, full of hate!

1066
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:33,598
He's right.

1067
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:35,600
Where is Inosuke looking?

1068
01:10:35,835 --> 01:10:37,169
It's hard to tell.

1069
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,703
Anyways,

1070
01:10:38,805 --> 01:10:41,173
I just need to chop this guy's head off.

1071
01:10:45,678 --> 01:10:46,945
Inosuke!

1072
01:10:47,213 --> 01:10:50,215
You won't stop me from dreaming!

1073
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,623
Did he stab you?

1074
01:10:58,691 --> 01:10:59,958
I'm fine.

1075
01:11:02,428 --> 01:11:04,262
Why bother with that bastard?

1076
01:11:04,697 --> 01:11:06,798
No, we can't let him die.

1077
01:11:08,434 --> 01:11:10,468
Hurry up and cut off the demon's neck!

1078
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:11,970
We can't hold out for much longer!

1079
01:11:11,971 --> 01:11:12,971
I know.

1080
01:11:13,206 --> 01:11:14,105
Move fast.

1081
01:11:31,524 --> 01:11:32,357
Inosuke.

1082
01:11:32,959 --> 01:11:34,493
Breathe well.

1083
01:11:34,727 --> 01:11:36,261
We'll cut off the demon's neck together.

1084
01:11:36,796 --> 01:11:37,996
Keep attacking.

1085
01:12:13,933 --> 01:12:14,900
This is bad.

1086
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:16,334
If I fall asleep now.

1087
01:12:16,869 --> 01:12:17,702
Hateful!

1088
01:12:18,271 --> 01:12:20,071
I'm going to rush him, watch my back!

1089
01:12:20,673 --> 01:12:23,208
Beast Breathing!
Third Fang!

1090
01:12:26,379 --> 01:12:28,346
Devour!

1091
01:12:32,018 --> 01:12:33,385
Please bless me.

1092
01:12:33,386 --> 01:12:34,152
Dad, please bless me.

1093
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:37,222
Let me chop off the bones with one blow.

1094
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:39,624
Let me chop off the bones with one blow!

1095
01:12:40,259 --> 01:12:41,660
Dance of the Fire God!

1096
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:45,363
Clear Blue Sky!

1097
01:13:06,786 --> 01:13:08,720
What a scream, and the shaking!

1098
01:13:09,021 --> 01:13:11,723
It's going to roll over, Inosuke!

1099
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:15,126
Wait, is your stomach okay?

1100
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:18,797
Inosuke, protect passengers!

1101
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:22,133
I can't die.

1102
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:24,402
If i die,

1103
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:26,538
that person will become a murderer.

1104
01:13:27,106 --> 01:13:28,306
I can't die.

1105
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,978
I don't want anyone to die.

1106
01:13:59,339 --> 01:14:01,673
Are you okay? Santaro?

1107
01:14:04,177 --> 01:14:05,944
Cheer me up!

1108
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:08,714
This demon's body is too elastic and became a meat pad.

1109
01:14:08,882 --> 01:14:10,716
But we're saved!

1110
01:14:11,217 --> 01:14:13,052
Is your stomach okay?

1111
01:14:13,086 --> 01:14:14,887
Is the stabbed belly okay?

1112
01:14:15,055 --> 01:14:17,923
I don't care.

1113
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:19,892
How about Inosuke?

1114
01:14:19,993 --> 01:14:23,195
The Lord is full of vitality, not even a small cold!

1115
01:14:23,897 --> 01:14:26,865
I can't move yet.

1116
01:14:28,101 --> 01:14:30,502
Hurry up and save the others.

1117
01:14:32,072 --> 01:14:34,106
I wonder if anyone was injured?

1118
01:14:35,341 --> 01:14:38,744
Near the demon's neck... where is the driver?

1119
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,148
I think it's best that guy died.

1120
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,384
That's not good at all.

1121
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:48,320
He's the one who stabbed you in the stomach!

1122
01:14:48,321 --> 01:14:50,189
That guy's foot was pinched by the train,

1123
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:51,457
he can't move at all.

1124
01:14:52,192 --> 01:14:54,526
His feet are squashed and he can't move at all.

1125
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:55,861
Leave it alone.

1126
01:14:56,396 --> 01:14:57,429
In this case

1127
01:14:57,464 --> 01:14:59,898
he has been punished enough.

1128
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,067
Hurry and save him.

1129
01:15:04,537 --> 01:15:05,771
Please.

1130
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,480
I'm going.

1131
01:15:14,747 --> 01:15:16,648
Who told me to be your boss?

1132
01:15:16,649 --> 01:15:18,684
I did it because my men begged me.

1133
01:15:18,985 --> 01:15:20,352
After saving the others

1134
01:15:20,386 --> 01:15:23,088
I'm going to pull out all of his hair.

1135
01:15:24,224 --> 01:15:26,759
You don't have to do that.

1136
01:15:31,498 --> 01:15:33,532
It looks like the Sun is about to dawn.

1137
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:36,668
I need to adjust my breathing.

1138
01:15:37,937 --> 01:15:43,342
You have to rescue the injured quickly.

1139
01:15:45,145 --> 01:15:49,848
Nezuko, Zenitsu, Rengoku.

1140
01:15:51,284 --> 01:15:54,987
I'm sure they'll be alright.

1141
01:16:02,295 --> 01:16:06,498
My body is disintegrated, there is no way to regenerate.

1142
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,602
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

1143
01:16:10,703 --> 01:16:11,904
Me?

1144
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:14,806
How is this possible...?

1145
01:16:14,807 --> 01:16:16,975
I haven't tried my best!

1146
01:16:17,644 --> 01:16:20,112
I haven't even eaten a human.

1147
01:16:20,613 --> 01:16:21,980
Integrate with the train.

1148
01:16:21,981 --> 01:16:24,116
An excellent plan to devour a large number of humans at once.

1149
01:16:24,117 --> 01:16:25,851
All for nothing!

1150
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:28,687
I am like this now,

1151
01:16:29,355 --> 01:16:32,591
when I spent so much effort and time...

1152
01:16:33,193 --> 01:16:34,326
It's that guy.

1153
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:36,495
It's that guy!

1154
01:16:37,063 --> 01:16:40,666
I was holding the life of priceless hostages.

1155
01:16:40,667 --> 01:16:42,534
But I'm still ruled by others!

1156
01:16:42,535 --> 01:16:44,403
He controls everything.

1157
01:16:44,437 --> 01:16:46,705
Is this the power of a Hashira?

1158
01:16:47,407 --> 01:16:48,574
That kid.

1159
01:16:48,608 --> 01:16:50,642
That kid is moving so fast.

1160
01:16:50,643 --> 01:16:53,579
Obviously, the sleep technique has not completely subsided.

1161
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,280
And the girl.

1162
01:16:55,615 --> 01:16:57,015
Isn't she a demon?

1163
01:16:57,016 --> 01:16:58,150
What happened?

1164
01:16:58,151 --> 01:17:00,619
How can a demon partner with a demon slayer?

1165
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:03,422
Why was she not killed by Master?

1166
01:17:05,325 --> 01:17:08,193
I hate...

1167
01:17:08,661 --> 01:17:09,828
To put it plainly,

1168
01:17:09,929 --> 01:17:11,997
it's all the fault of that kid who figured out my technique.

1169
01:17:11,998 --> 01:17:13,932
That made me feel bad.

1170
01:17:14,701 --> 01:17:16,668
It's that kid's fault.

1171
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,203
Anyway,

1172
01:17:18,204 --> 01:17:21,073
even if you can only kill that kid.

1173
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:23,854
There's also that boar.

1174
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:27,224
If there was only that kid, I would have killed him.

1175
01:17:27,825 --> 01:17:29,826
I blame the boar.

1176
01:17:29,827 --> 01:17:32,095
His instinct is so sensitive.

1177
01:17:32,096 --> 01:17:34,331
He is really sensitive to sight.

1178
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,469
Am I going to lose? Am I going to die?

1179
01:17:41,372 --> 01:17:45,108
This is a nightmare, it must be a nightmare!

1180
01:17:46,377 --> 01:17:47,844
Killed by the demon slayers!

1181
01:17:47,845 --> 01:17:50,714
It's always the the bottom of the barrel.

1182
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,549
Thinking about it...

1183
01:17:52,684 --> 01:17:53,750
in this century

1184
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:56,119
are all demons with familiar faces

1185
01:17:56,387 --> 01:17:58,989
who have defeated countless Pillars in the Demon Slayer Corp.

1186
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:01,158
Are these the opponents of the Waxing Moons?

1187
01:18:01,759 --> 01:18:03,861
Is the strength of the Waxing Moons
from a different dimension?

1188
01:18:05,129 --> 01:18:07,231
I have accumulated so much blood,

1189
01:18:07,232 --> 01:18:09,866
and yet still far behind the Waxing Moons.

1190
01:18:12,003 --> 01:18:15,405
I really want to start all over again.

1191
01:18:15,406 --> 01:18:20,944
How could there be such a miserable nightmare.

1192
01:18:28,152 --> 01:18:31,121
It seems that you have learned to concentrate on your breathing.

1193
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:32,623
Admirable.

1194
01:18:33,825 --> 01:18:35,259
Rengoku.

1195
01:18:35,893 --> 01:18:38,495
Learning to stay in school is the first step to becoming a Pillar.

1196
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:40,197
Before becoming a Pillar,

1197
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:42,065
you may have ten thousand steps to go.

1198
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:44,801
I will work hard.

1199
01:18:45,937 --> 01:18:47,971
Your abdomen is bleeding heavily.

1200
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:49,773
Focus.

1201
01:18:49,774 --> 01:18:51,475
Improve the accuracy of your breathing.

1202
01:18:51,809 --> 01:18:54,778
Concentrate on carrying your breath to every part of your body.

1203
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,247
Don't forget the blood vessels.

1204
01:18:57,515 --> 01:18:59,283
To repair broken blood vessels.

1205
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:04,388
Strengthen concentration.

1206
01:19:15,933 --> 01:19:17,000
Right there.

1207
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:19,236
Stop the bleeding quickly, you must stop the bleeding.

1208
01:19:24,809 --> 01:19:26,076
Focus.

1209
01:19:36,554 --> 01:19:37,988
The bleeding has stopped.

1210
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,257
As long as you can master the breathing methods

1211
01:19:40,258 --> 01:19:42,359
you can do things ordinary people can't do.

1212
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,128
Although not everything can be done.

1213
01:19:45,196 --> 01:19:46,530
But it does make you

1214
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:49,032
become stronger than yesterday's self.

1215
01:19:51,002 --> 01:19:51,401
I understand.

1216
01:19:53,671 --> 01:19:55,339
Everyone is safe.

1217
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,740
Although there are many injured,

1218
01:19:56,741 --> 01:19:58,075
none of their injuries are life-threatening.

1219
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:02,512
You don't need to be strong now, take a good rest.

1220
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:08,852
Thank you very much.

1221
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,284
A Waxing Moon.

1222
01:20:42,053 --> 01:20:43,687
Why is it here?

1223
01:20:56,901 --> 01:20:58,869
Flame Breathing!
Second Form!

1224
01:21:01,172 --> 01:21:02,639
Rising Scorching Sun!

1225
01:21:12,917 --> 01:21:14,818
What an excellent sword.

1226
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:18,388
He regenerates quickly.

1227
01:21:18,689 --> 01:21:21,191
This strong of a sense of oppression...

1228
01:21:21,426 --> 01:21:23,026
This is a Waxing Moon.

1229
01:21:23,661 --> 01:21:24,628
I can not understand

1230
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,963
why you chose to attack the injured person first?

1231
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:30,967
Because I think he will prevent me from talking to you.

1232
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:32,369
Just like this.

1233
01:21:32,904 --> 01:21:34,905
What can I say to you?

1234
01:21:35,506 --> 01:21:37,174
Although this is the first time we have met

1235
01:21:37,175 --> 01:21:39,509
I am already annoyed.

1236
01:21:39,944 --> 01:21:41,244
Is that so?

1237
01:21:41,512 --> 01:21:44,047
I also hate weak humans the most.

1238
01:21:44,415 --> 01:21:46,917
Seeing useless people makes me sick.

1239
01:21:47,518 --> 01:21:49,085
It looks like you and me

1240
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:51,621
have completely different standards and values.

1241
01:21:52,957 --> 01:21:55,592
Let me give you a wonderful proposal.

1242
01:21:56,093 --> 01:21:58,662
Do you want to join us as a demon?

1243
01:21:58,996 --> 01:22:00,363
Of course not.

1244
01:22:00,698 --> 01:22:02,299
I know at a glance

1245
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,800
that power

1246
01:22:03,968 --> 01:22:05,302
are you a Hashira?

1247
01:22:05,937 --> 01:22:08,305
Your abilities have been tempered

1248
01:22:08,773 --> 01:22:10,874
close to the highest level.

1249
01:22:11,476 --> 01:22:13,343
I am the Flame of the Nine Pillars.

1250
01:22:13,344 --> 01:22:15,078
My name is Kyojuro Rengoku.

1251
01:22:15,713 --> 01:22:17,414
I am Akaza.

1252
01:22:17,982 --> 01:22:20,650
Kyojuro, let me tell you

1253
01:22:20,718 --> 01:22:21,985
why you missed the gate

1254
01:22:22,019 --> 01:22:23,987
unable to step into the highest realm.

1255
01:22:24,555 --> 01:22:26,256
Because you are human.

1256
01:22:26,591 --> 01:22:29,092
Because you will grow old, because you will die.

1257
01:22:31,129 --> 01:22:33,663
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

1258
01:22:34,432 --> 01:22:35,599
In this way

1259
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:37,767
whether it's a hundred years or two-hundred years

1260
01:22:37,768 --> 01:22:40,403
you can keep improving, you can become stronger.

1261
01:22:42,206 --> 01:22:44,274
Among all the demons I have encountered so far

1262
01:22:44,475 --> 01:22:46,843
his smell is closest to Kibutsuji Muzan.

1263
01:22:47,311 --> 01:22:49,579
I have to get up,
I have to support Rengoku.

1264
01:22:50,314 --> 01:22:52,983
Aging and the declining towards death

1265
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:55,252
is what makes a short-lived creature like a human

1266
01:22:55,253 --> 01:22:56,586
beautiful.

1267
01:22:56,988 --> 01:23:00,423
Precisely because people will grow old, precisely because people will die

1268
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:03,426
talent will always be so lovely and noble.

1269
01:23:04,962 --> 01:23:06,530
So-called "power"

1270
01:23:06,931 --> 01:23:09,666
is not an adjective that only applies to the physical.

1271
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:15,906
This boy is not weak at all.

1272
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:18,775
Do not insult him.

1273
01:23:19,443 --> 01:23:21,044
I can say it as many times as needed.

1274
01:23:21,445 --> 01:23:24,147
Your standards are completely different from mine.

1275
01:23:25,016 --> 01:23:26,883
No matter how many reasons you give me

1276
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:28,685
I will not be a demon.

1277
01:23:33,858 --> 01:23:35,225
Is that so?

1278
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:38,061
Blood Arts!

1279
01:23:38,196 --> 01:23:38,995
Technique Development!

1280
01:23:41,232 --> 01:23:43,166
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

1281
01:23:58,316 --> 01:24:00,750
Since you don't want to be a demon, you should ready yourself.

1282
01:24:14,999 --> 01:24:17,534
I can't see their movements.

1283
01:24:17,535 --> 01:24:19,603
Among the Pillars I have killed so far

1284
01:24:19,604 --> 01:24:21,304
no one was a Flame Pillar.

1285
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:24,407
And no one agreed to become a demon...

1286
01:24:24,408 --> 01:24:25,709
my invitation.

1287
01:24:29,614 --> 01:24:31,648
Why on Earth would you deny the invitation?

1288
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:33,984
I am also pursuing the highest state of martial arts.

1289
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:35,719
I really can't understand.

1290
01:24:36,387 --> 01:24:39,489
Obviously only those who are selected can become demons.

1291
01:24:45,062 --> 01:24:46,896
Looking at people with perfect talent.

1292
01:24:46,897 --> 01:24:48,665
Becoming ugly with age.

1293
01:24:49,233 --> 01:24:51,568
It's so sad.

1294
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:54,638
Just die, Kyojuro.

1295
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:56,606
While you are young and strong.

1296
01:24:58,976 --> 01:25:02,379
Destructive Death: Air!

1297
01:25:16,093 --> 01:25:16,993
That's it.

1298
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:20,864
Flame Breathing!

1299
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:22,399
Fourth Form!

1300
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,467
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1301
01:25:26,804 --> 01:25:28,371
Throwing his fists through the air

1302
01:25:28,539 --> 01:25:29,973
he can attack me

1303
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:35,145
at a speed the fraction of an instant.

1304
01:25:41,552 --> 01:25:43,753
If we fight at this distance

1305
01:25:44,221 --> 01:25:46,222
it will be difficult to cut him.

1306
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:47,657
In that case.

1307
01:25:53,097 --> 01:25:54,531
I'll be close!

1308
01:25:55,599 --> 01:25:57,901
Perfect speed.

1309
01:26:00,805 --> 01:26:03,940
Such superb swordsmanship is disappearing from the world!

1310
01:26:04,308 --> 01:26:07,010
Kyojuro!
Don't you feel sad?

1311
01:26:07,445 --> 01:26:08,545
It won't be sad

1312
01:26:08,779 --> 01:26:11,014
because it is natural for humans to die!

1313
01:26:12,383 --> 01:26:13,349
Do not move!

1314
01:26:14,185 --> 01:26:16,219
If the wound opens, it will become fatal!

1315
01:26:16,554 --> 01:26:17,721
You are there on standby!

1316
01:26:19,156 --> 01:26:21,291
Don't care about the weak, Kyojuro!

1317
01:26:21,692 --> 01:26:23,126
Use your utmost ability!

1318
01:26:26,297 --> 01:26:27,731
Do you think you can beat me?

1319
01:26:40,277 --> 01:26:41,711
You really are agile!

1320
01:26:48,185 --> 01:26:49,185
Rengoku!

1321
01:26:49,186 --> 01:26:50,620
Mr. Big Eyes!

1322
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:56,292
Become a demon, Kyoujuro.

1323
01:27:00,664 --> 01:27:03,433
In this way, you and me can fight forever.

1324
01:27:03,434 --> 01:27:04,934
Improve each other's abilities.

1325
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,808
You have the qualifications to fight with me.

1326
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:14,544
I reject your offer.

1327
01:27:14,945 --> 01:27:18,348
Ask me again, I dare you.

1328
01:27:21,886 --> 01:27:23,820
I will never be a demon.

1329
01:27:24,688 --> 01:27:25,955
Flame Breathing!

1330
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:28,591
Third Form!

1331
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,760
Fiery Spirits!

1332
01:27:34,098 --> 01:27:36,266
That's great!
You really are dangerous!

1333
01:27:37,635 --> 01:27:40,003
Keep going!

1334
01:27:48,579 --> 01:27:51,848
No flaws, no way to intervene.

1335
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:53,850
It's so fast that I can't keep up.

1336
01:27:54,218 --> 01:27:56,886
Those two are fighting in a different dimension.

1337
01:27:57,288 --> 01:27:58,788
If you break in

1338
01:27:58,789 --> 01:28:01,157
there's no way you'd survive.

1339
01:28:01,826 --> 01:28:03,593
Even if you wanted to help

1340
01:28:03,727 --> 01:28:05,328
that would just be a disservice.

1341
01:28:05,329 --> 01:28:07,030
So I dare not move at all.

1342
01:28:10,234 --> 01:28:11,601
Rengoku.

1343
01:28:16,173 --> 01:28:17,874
Haven't you figured it out yet?

1344
01:28:18,142 --> 01:28:19,909
If you keep attacking me

1345
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:22,145
it means you've chosen your own death.

1346
01:28:22,146 --> 01:28:23,279
Kyojuro!

1347
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:34,624
Flame Breathing!
First Form!

1348
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:36,092
Unknowing Fire!

1349
01:28:38,429 --> 01:28:40,563
What a pity to kill you here!

1350
01:28:41,098 --> 01:28:43,333
You haven’t even reached your peak!

1351
01:28:49,106 --> 01:28:50,139
Second Form!

1352
01:28:51,508 --> 01:28:53,076
Rising Scorching Sun!

1353
01:28:54,678 --> 01:28:56,412
One or two years from now

1354
01:28:56,413 --> 01:28:58,114
your moves will be more refined

1355
01:28:58,115 --> 01:28:59,549
their lethality will also increase.

1356
01:29:11,629 --> 01:29:14,497
Third Form!
Fiery Spirits!

1357
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:18,735
Fourth Form!
Blooming Flame Undulation!

1358
01:29:21,805 --> 01:29:23,273
Destructive Death!

1359
01:29:24,975 --> 01:29:28,044
Fifth Form!
Flame Tiger!

1360
01:29:31,315 --> 01:29:32,515
Disorder!

1361
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:38,521
Kyojuro!

1362
01:29:55,172 --> 01:29:57,807
Did it succeed? Did you beat him?

1363
01:30:26,704 --> 01:30:27,971
Will noth...

1364
01:30:34,511 --> 01:30:36,112
How could this be?

1365
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:45,221
Keep fighting with me.

1366
01:30:46,724 --> 01:30:48,358
Don't die, Kyojuro.

1367
01:31:05,109 --> 01:31:09,178
Rengoku.

1368
01:31:11,248 --> 01:31:12,749
Rengoku!

1369
01:31:17,488 --> 01:31:20,590
Even if you fight with the determination to sacrifice yourself.

1370
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:23,626
Everything is in vain, Kyojuro.

1371
01:31:24,962 --> 01:31:26,763
That superb slash you inflicted.

1372
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:28,664
No matter how fierce.

1373
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:30,900
The wound can heal in an instant.

1374
01:31:31,535 --> 01:31:33,269
But look at yourself.

1375
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:36,873
The left eye is completely ruined and the ribs are almost shattered.

1376
01:31:36,874 --> 01:31:38,441
Internal organs are also damaged.

1377
01:31:38,509 --> 01:31:40,676
Usually those injuries are impossible to recover from.

1378
01:31:41,045 --> 01:31:42,145
But if you are a demon

1379
01:31:42,179 --> 01:31:44,180
those injuries can be recovered at a glance.

1380
01:31:44,415 --> 01:31:47,316
This kind of injury is just a small scratch to the demon.

1381
01:31:47,851 --> 01:31:49,619
No matter how hard you struggle

1382
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,621
humans cannot defeat demons.

1383
01:31:54,224 --> 01:31:56,492
I really want to help.

1384
01:31:59,063 --> 01:32:01,631
My hands are feet just won't move.

1385
01:32:02,032 --> 01:32:04,167
Although my condition is not separate from my injuries

1386
01:32:04,168 --> 01:32:06,836
after using the Dance of the Fire God, I will be like this.

1387
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:22,652
Kyojuro, you...

1388
01:32:24,555 --> 01:32:25,421
I will...

1389
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,325
I will perform my duty well.

1390
01:32:29,793 --> 01:32:30,760
Everyone here!

1391
01:32:30,794 --> 01:32:31,260


1392
01:32:31,395 --> 01:32:32,929
None of them will die!

1393
01:32:34,698 --> 01:32:35,832
It must be done in an instant.

1394
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:38,034
Destroy him completely.

1395
01:32:38,435 --> 01:32:40,002
Flame Breathing!

1396
01:32:40,404 --> 01:32:41,270
Ninth Form!

1397
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:49,645
What incredible power!

1398
01:32:49,847 --> 01:32:51,180
To have such serious injuries

1399
01:32:51,181 --> 01:32:52,648
and still show perfect resolve!

1400
01:32:52,649 --> 01:32:54,617
Such spiritual power!

1401
01:32:54,818 --> 01:32:57,019
There is no flaw in the posture.

1402
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:03,559
You think you are above being a demon, Kyojuro?

1403
01:33:03,927 --> 01:33:06,629
Let us fight each other forever!

1404
01:33:07,097 --> 01:33:08,698
Burn!

1405
01:33:09,633 --> 01:33:11,534
Burn beyond your limits!

1406
01:33:12,669 --> 01:33:14,036
I am the Pillar of Flame!

1407
01:33:14,872 --> 01:33:16,672
Rengoku Kyojuro!

1408
01:33:17,307 --> 01:33:18,708
Ninth Form!

1409
01:33:18,709 --> 01:33:20,710
Rengoku!

1410
01:33:21,311 --> 01:33:24,080
Destructive Death: Annihilation!

1411
01:33:41,165 --> 01:33:42,498
Rengoku!

1412
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:17,133
Rengoku!

1413
01:34:22,206 --> 01:34:23,639
Rengoku!

1414
01:34:26,176 --> 01:34:27,143
See.

1415
01:34:27,644 --> 01:34:29,712
Rengoku!

1416
01:34:40,891 --> 01:34:42,058
You will die!

1417
01:34:42,059 --> 01:34:43,960
You will really die, Kyojuro!

1418
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:45,461
Be a demon!

1419
01:34:45,796 --> 01:34:47,363
Say you are going to be a demon!

1420
01:34:47,898 --> 01:34:52,134
You are one of the few selected!

1421
01:35:05,315 --> 01:35:06,549
Kyojuro.

1422
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:08,217
Yes, Mother.

1423
01:35:09,486 --> 01:35:11,320
You have to think carefully

1424
01:35:11,521 --> 01:35:13,956
about Mother's next question.

1425
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,925
You know yourself.

1426
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:19,795
Why are you born stronger than others?

1427
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:25,001
I do not know.

1428
01:35:25,936 --> 01:35:28,404
To help those weaker than yourself.

1429
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,275
You were born blessed.

1430
01:35:32,276 --> 01:35:34,644
Someone who has more talent than others.

1431
01:35:35,445 --> 01:35:36,779
That power

1432
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,714
must be used selflessly.

1433
01:35:38,849 --> 01:35:40,850
Make good use of it for others.

1434
01:35:42,185 --> 01:35:44,387
Take advantage of the power granted by Heaven.

1435
01:35:44,688 --> 01:35:46,789
To hurt others

1436
01:35:46,923 --> 01:35:49,725
is not allowed.

1437
01:35:50,927 --> 01:35:53,562
Help the weak.
Anytime, anywhere.

1438
01:35:53,597 --> 01:35:56,432
It’s your job to be strong.

1439
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,534
You have to take responsibility.

1440
01:35:58,568 --> 01:36:00,970
That is your mission to be carried out.

1441
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:05,174
You must not forget this.

1442
01:36:05,809 --> 01:36:06,776
Yes.

1443
01:36:23,727 --> 01:36:27,763
I'm afraid I don't have much time left.

1444
01:36:28,665 --> 01:36:31,534
To be the mother of a strong and kind child

1445
01:36:31,702 --> 01:36:33,269
makes me very happy.

1446
01:36:35,372 --> 01:36:37,306
I wish you well, son.

1447
01:36:50,454 --> 01:36:51,454
Mother!

1448
01:36:51,989 --> 01:36:55,057
To think I could have a Mother like you!

1449
01:36:55,325 --> 01:36:56,892
I feel very honored!

1450
01:37:05,102 --> 01:37:06,035
Blocked?

1451
01:37:06,636 --> 01:37:08,637
What unbelievable power!

1452
01:37:08,872 --> 01:37:12,007
My right hand has penetrated his vital organs!

1453
01:37:13,977 --> 01:37:16,979
Oh no, it's almost dawn!

1454
01:37:17,714 --> 01:37:19,849
I have to kill him and leave this place!

1455
01:37:21,651 --> 01:37:23,819
I can't pull out my hand!

1456
01:37:26,189 --> 01:37:27,623
You will not escape!

1457
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:38,467
No matter what Rengoku will call me afterwards

1458
01:37:40,203 --> 01:37:43,038
I have to do it!

1459
01:37:43,974 --> 01:37:47,076
I have to cut off his neck!

1460
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:48,244
Faster!

1461
01:37:51,148 --> 01:37:52,615
Dawn...!

1462
01:37:53,183 --> 01:37:54,984
The sun will shine soon!

1463
01:37:56,119 --> 01:37:59,355
I must run away quickly!

1464
01:38:08,565 --> 01:38:10,499
I will never let you go

1465
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:13,602
until your neck is cut off!

1466
01:38:16,773 --> 01:38:18,808
Get off of me!

1467
01:38:23,213 --> 01:38:25,414
Inosuke, move quickly!

1468
01:38:26,016 --> 01:38:28,951
Move for Rengoku!

1469
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:35,257
Beast Breathing!
First Fang!

1470
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:37,626
Pierce!

1471
01:38:55,579 --> 01:38:58,447
I have to get away from the Sun immediately!

1472
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:10,059
This is bad!

1473
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,261
I must be as far away from the Sun as possible!

1474
01:39:19,803 --> 01:39:21,203
Don't run away!

1475
01:39:22,138 --> 01:39:23,706
Don't run away, you bastard!

1476
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:25,608
Don't run away!

1477
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:31,080
What kind of nonsense is that?

1478
01:39:31,414 --> 01:39:33,949
Isn't there a brain in his head?

1479
01:39:34,184 --> 01:39:36,752
I didn't run away because of you or the demon slayers.

1480
01:39:37,053 --> 01:39:39,054
I ran away to escape the Sun!

1481
01:39:39,556 --> 01:39:42,491
What's more, the outcome has already been decided!

1482
01:39:42,759 --> 01:39:45,995
That guy will run out of strength and die soon!

1483
01:39:48,665 --> 01:39:50,299
No matter where you go

1484
01:39:50,734 --> 01:39:52,201
the Demon Slayer Corp. will always be there!

1485
01:39:52,202 --> 01:39:53,469
Fight in the darkness

1486
01:39:53,470 --> 01:39:54,937
that's the only place you can fight!

1487
01:39:54,971 --> 01:39:57,139
We are flesh and blood!

1488
01:39:57,173 --> 01:40:00,075
Our wounds cannot heal easily

1489
01:40:00,076 --> 01:40:02,378
and it's impossibe to recover your hands and feet!

1490
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,714
You are not allowed to run, you bastard!

1491
01:40:05,715 --> 01:40:08,784
You wicked, despicable creature!

1492
01:40:09,252 --> 01:40:10,653
Compared to guys like you

1493
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:13,289
Rengoku is far greater!

1494
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:15,157
Far greater than you!

1495
01:40:15,358 --> 01:40:17,326
Rengoku did not lose!

1496
01:40:17,327 --> 01:40:19,795
He didn't let anyone on the train die!

1497
01:40:19,963 --> 01:40:22,865
He fought to the end and successfully protected everyone!

1498
01:40:23,099 --> 01:40:24,934
You lost!

1499
01:40:25,168 --> 01:40:29,638
Rengoku defeated you!

1500
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,808
Stop screaming so loudly.

1501
01:41:11,681 --> 01:41:13,749
The wound in your stomach will open.

1502
01:41:14,317 --> 01:41:16,285
Your injury is not minor.

1503
01:41:17,487 --> 01:41:19,622
Novice swordsman, if you die

1504
01:41:20,023 --> 01:41:22,424
it means that I lose the battle.

1505
01:41:24,327 --> 01:41:26,028
Rengoku.

1506
01:41:26,896 --> 01:41:28,264
Come to me.

1507
01:41:28,798 --> 01:41:31,200
I have something to tell you.

1508
01:41:49,185 --> 01:41:50,986
I remembered something.

1509
01:41:52,722 --> 01:41:55,124
I remembered when I dreamed of the past.

1510
01:41:56,292 --> 01:41:57,893
Of the home where I was born.

1511
01:41:58,628 --> 01:42:00,829
You can go there if you wish.

1512
01:42:02,098 --> 01:42:05,434
There is a collection of notes left by Flame swordsman of the past.

1513
01:42:07,404 --> 01:42:09,838
My father used to read those notes.

1514
01:42:10,507 --> 01:42:12,074
Because i haven't seen it

1515
01:42:12,242 --> 01:42:13,809
I don't know the exact contents.

1516
01:42:16,212 --> 01:42:17,880
What you told me earlier

1517
01:42:18,181 --> 01:42:20,616
about the God of Destruction, Kagura.

1518
01:42:21,618 --> 01:42:23,952
Maybe there will be records in those notes.

1519
01:42:26,389 --> 01:42:29,024
Rengoku, please stop talking like this.

1520
01:42:29,125 --> 01:42:31,226
Please use breathing to stop the bleeding!

1521
01:42:31,361 --> 01:42:33,762
Is there no way to make the wound heal?

1522
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:35,297
No.

1523
01:42:35,632 --> 01:42:37,900
I will die soon.

1524
01:42:40,103 --> 01:42:42,638
I'll talk as long as I can.

1525
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:43,839
Just listen.

1526
01:42:45,642 --> 01:42:47,843
Please tell my brother Senjuro

1527
01:42:48,645 --> 01:42:50,679
Ask him to do what he wants.

1528
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:53,949
Move on the path you feel right.

1529
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:55,551
This is my wish.

1530
01:42:58,154 --> 01:42:59,555
Tell my Father.

1531
01:43:00,323 --> 01:43:02,758
I hope he can take care of his health.

1532
01:43:05,195 --> 01:43:07,196
Also, mountain boy.

1533
01:43:07,197 --> 01:43:08,363
Also, boy with the box.

1534
01:43:11,134 --> 01:43:13,402
I am willing to believe you.

1535
01:43:14,637 --> 01:43:17,172
I agree that she is a member of the Demon Slayer Corp.

1536
01:43:19,642 --> 01:43:20,909
When I was on the train

1537
01:43:21,311 --> 01:43:23,278
I saw the girl bleeding

1538
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:25,047
working hard to protect mankind.

1539
01:43:25,715 --> 01:43:27,683
Risking her life to fight demons.

1540
01:43:27,817 --> 01:43:29,384
She protects humanity.

1541
01:43:29,986 --> 01:43:31,520
No matter what others say.

1542
01:43:31,588 --> 01:43:33,487
Your sister is part of the Demon Slayer Corp.

1543
01:43:34,591 --> 01:43:36,692
Stand tall and live.

1544
01:43:41,731 --> 01:43:44,199
Regardless of your own weaknesses.

1545
01:43:44,601 --> 01:43:46,435
No matter how hard you are hit.

1546
01:43:48,438 --> 01:43:50,105
Burn in your heart.

1547
01:43:53,209 --> 01:43:55,577
Grit your teeth and move forward.

1548
01:43:57,013 --> 01:43:59,615
Even if you stop and rest.

1549
01:44:00,283 --> 01:44:02,918
The flow of time will not stop for you.

1550
01:44:03,419 --> 01:44:07,389
Time can't accompany you to bear grief.

1551
01:44:08,758 --> 01:44:11,160
Don't let my death fall too heavily upon you.

1552
01:44:12,095 --> 01:44:13,629
I am a Pillar.

1553
01:44:13,763 --> 01:44:16,698
I am a shield for younger generations.

1554
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,734
I am a Pillar

1555
01:44:19,035 --> 01:44:21,637
and any of them would have made the same choice.

1556
01:44:22,071 --> 01:44:24,606
I can't let the younger generation fail.

1557
01:44:25,441 --> 01:44:26,809
Red-haired boy.

1558
01:44:28,411 --> 01:44:29,778
Boarhead boy

1559
01:44:31,147 --> 01:44:32,548
Yellow-haired boy.

1560
01:44:33,716 --> 01:44:35,984
You must continue to grow.

1561
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,420
Believe in the near future.

1562
01:44:38,621 --> 01:44:41,990
You are the future of the Demon Slayers.

1563
01:44:43,693 --> 01:44:45,160
I trust you.

1564
01:44:46,296 --> 01:44:48,597
I trust you from the bottom of my heart.

1565
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:15,691
Mother?

1566
01:45:20,263 --> 01:45:22,531
Have I done it?

1567
01:45:24,734 --> 01:45:28,203
Things I should do, things I have to practice?

1568
01:45:28,905 --> 01:45:30,439
Did I do it all?

1569
01:45:40,316 --> 01:45:42,351
You did very well.

1570
01:46:19,122 --> 01:46:20,889
When the train derailed

1571
01:46:21,591 --> 01:46:24,159
Rengoku used many techniques.

1572
01:46:25,161 --> 01:46:27,563
He did his best to damage the carriage

1573
01:46:27,564 --> 01:46:29,865
and minimize the harm to humans.

1574
01:46:31,401 --> 01:46:32,768
That's right.

1575
01:46:34,437 --> 01:46:36,605
How could such a person die?

1576
01:46:37,073 --> 01:46:39,641
Did a Waxing Moon really show up?

1577
01:46:41,978 --> 01:46:44,546
Why did a Waxing Moon come here?

1578
01:46:44,847 --> 01:46:46,615
Are they really that powerful?

1579
01:46:46,716 --> 01:46:48,050
How could...

1580
01:46:51,888 --> 01:46:53,488
Why is it...

1581
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:57,859
when you're close to completing your mission,

1582
01:46:59,262 --> 01:47:00,629
right in front of you,

1583
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:03,865
another high wall appears.

1584
01:47:05,401 --> 01:47:06,702
Novice swordsmen, all powerful,

1585
01:47:06,736 --> 01:47:10,272
all killed and fought in far-away places.

1586
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,742
And yet I still don't have the ability to go there.

1587
01:47:15,078 --> 01:47:18,447
I'm stuck in this place!

1588
01:47:23,686 --> 01:47:28,090
Can I become a strong man like Rengoku?

1589
01:47:38,167 --> 01:47:40,402
Don't say such discouraging words!

1590
01:47:42,205 --> 01:47:44,139
No one cares if you can be like him!

1591
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:46,274
Don't talk about this kind of nonsense!

1592
01:47:46,709 --> 01:47:48,143
Since he said he believed in you!

1593
01:47:48,177 --> 01:47:49,878
In addition to his trust,

1594
01:47:49,912 --> 01:47:51,747
there's no reason to think about these things!

1595
01:47:52,081 --> 01:47:55,283
The dead creatures just return to the dust!

1596
01:47:55,918 --> 01:47:57,319
Even if you are crying

1597
01:47:57,353 --> 01:47:59,054
he won't come back!

1598
01:47:59,522 --> 01:48:02,190
Don't cry, even if you're not reconciled!

1599
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:05,260
No matter how miserable, no matter how humiliated!

1600
01:48:05,328 --> 01:48:07,696
We must all continue to live!

1601
01:48:08,131 --> 01:48:09,965
Aren't you crying too?

1602
01:48:10,466 --> 01:48:13,402
Crying until tears came out of your headpiece?

1603
01:48:13,669 --> 01:48:15,704
The Lord did not cry!

1604
01:48:27,316 --> 01:48:29,618
Come over and train!

1605
01:49:15,832 --> 01:49:17,432
Rengoku is gone.

1606
01:49:37,854 --> 01:49:39,754
The Waxing Moons.

1607
01:49:40,189 --> 01:49:42,557
Even Rengoku was no match?

1608
01:49:47,396 --> 01:49:49,264
I do not believe it.

1609
01:49:56,506 --> 01:49:58,707
Namo Amitabha

1610
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:08,984
Aku bersumpah mereka akan dihancurkan. 
Setan yang menjijikkan.

1611
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,560
Apakah begitu?

1612
01:50:27,937 --> 01:50:30,238
Dua ratus penumpang di kereta

1613
01:50:30,606 --> 01:50:32,674
dan tidak ada yang meninggal.

1614
01:50:33,509 --> 01:50:35,977
Kyojuro bekerja sangat keras.

1615
01:50:36,379 --> 01:50:38,079
Dia adalah anak yang luar biasa.

1616
01:50:39,482 --> 01:50:41,116
Saya tidak akan kesepian.

1617
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:44,920
Lagi pula, saya tidak punya banyak waktu tersisa.

1618
01:50:47,356 --> 01:50:50,659
Segera saya akan melihat Kyojuro,

1619
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:54,296
dan Tanah Musim Semi yang Kekal.

1620
01:51:05,808 --> 01:51:10,512
Rengoku ...!

1621
01:51:13,149 --> 01:51:15,617
Rengoku ...!
